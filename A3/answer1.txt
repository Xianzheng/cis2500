Grading Scheme

Part 1: 2 marks - Compilation
Part 2: 4 marks - Creation of correct myContactsList.db file
Part 3: 4 marks - Retrieval of 2 contacts
Part 4: 2 marks - Test that you cannot forget to add a phone number or email
---
Total: 12 marks - Total

1. Compile their code using their makefile for 2 marks.  If there is not
   makefile or it does not work, compile up their code manually.  A
   successful compile is 1 mark.

2. Run their code with the test1.txt as input (or type it in by hand if
   there are problems redirecting input:

   $ rm myContactsList.db
   $ ./contacts < test1.txt

   This should enter 4 contacts (Antonie, Calvert, Chiu and Gillis).
   The myContactsList.db file should be 370 bytes long (check with ls -l).

   Success = 4 [part marks if they can show you that some of the contacts
   are in myContactsList.db]

3. Part of the test is the retrieval of 2 contacts by phone number - the 
   correct output is below [2 marks for each correct retrieval - they lose
   marks if any of the fields are incorrect or missing].

4. Run their code again and this time just try to not add anything to any of the
   requested fields.  This should be okay for First Name, Last Name, and Company
   Name but you should not be allowed to enter an empty field for Phone Number
   or Email.  Subtract 1 for each necessary field (Phone Number, Email) that can
   be entered as an empty field. Maximum: 2 marks.
